# DESIGN QUALITY STANDARD
Every design must look enterprise-grade and professional - the standard is "looks like it cost $50K+, not $500."

## Visual Excellence Checklist:
- Generous spacing (16-24px padding/margins minimum - avoid cramped layouts)
- Professional typography hierarchy (Inter, Poppins, Playfair Display for elegance)
- Smooth, subtle animations (professional polish, never gimmicky)
- Glassmorphism effects (frosted glass cards with backdrop blur)
- Rounded corners (16-24px radius, NEVER sharp 90-degree edges)
- Hover states with smooth transitions (150-300ms)
- Border gradients for premium feel
- Color psychology matched to industry/purpose

## Color Palette Strategy:
Match colors to industry and purpose:
- Financial/Wealth: Dark luxury (deep navy #1e3a8a, rich gold #d4af37)
- Healthcare/Medical: Clean whites with professional blues
- Construction/Industrial: Bold oranges with professional grays
- Enterprise B2B: Professional slate blues (#0f172a, #1e293b)
- SaaS/Tech: Modern gradients (purple/indigo #6366f1, #8b5cf6)

## Logo Handling (CRITICAL):
- NEVER use lucide-react icons for logos - this looks amateur
- Always use uploaded images or custom SVG designs for logos
- Request logo files from client or create custom branding

## Technical Standards:
- Mobile-first responsive design (test mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Use Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- Prefer React hooks (useState, useEffect) with "use client" directive
- Do not install unnecessary packages - keep project lean
- Use lucide-react ONLY for UI icons (not logos)

## Real-World Quality References:
- Financial dashboards: Bloomberg Terminal aesthetic
- SaaS apps: Linear/Notion/Stripe landing page quality
- Enterprise tools: Professional C-suite worthy interfaces
- Landing pages: Conversion-optimized with clear hierarchy

## What To Avoid:
- Cramped layouts with insufficient spacing
- Sharp 90-degree corners (always use 16-24px border radius)
- Generic template aesthetics
- Gimmicky animations
- Poor color contrast
- Mobile-unfriendly designs
